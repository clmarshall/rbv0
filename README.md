# RobloxESP Overlay Analysis Project

**IMPORTANT: This is a HYPOTHETICAL SECURITY RESEARCH project for educational purposes only.**

This project demonstrates how game overlays could potentially be implemented, serving as a case study for game developers to understand and protect against such techniques. It is part of security research to improve game integrity and should not be used for actual game modification.

## Project Overview

This proof-of-concept implementation explores overlay techniques using OpenGL and ImGui, demonstrating concepts that game developers should be aware of when implementing anti-cheat protections.

### Educational Purpose

- Understand potential exploitation techniques
- Research game security vulnerabilities
- Develop better protection mechanisms
- Study overlay implementation methods

## Technical Details

- C++17
- OpenGL 3.3
- Dear ImGui
- GLFW3

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

### Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Code Review Findings

The current implementation has identified several areas that real game developers should be aware of:

1. Window Management
   - Transparent overlay capabilities
   - Full-screen overlay techniques
   - Window layering methods

2. Performance Considerations
   - Frame rate management
   - Resource usage patterns
   - Rendering optimization opportunities

3. Security Implications
   - Process interaction methods
   - Memory access patterns
   - Anti-debug considerations

## Disclaimer

This project is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. It is designed to help game developers understand potential security vulnerabilities and improve their game's protection mechanisms. Any use of this code for actual game modification would likely violate terms of service and could result in account termination.
